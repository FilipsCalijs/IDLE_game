# README: Idle Game Development Journey

## Introduction

This README outlines my plan to learn game development, create a simple game, and then develop and publish a commercial idle game using Unity.

## Objectives

1. **Learn Game Development Basics**
2. **Create a Simple Game**
3. **Develop and Publish a Commercial Idle Game**

- Create small projects focusing on movement, UI elements, and animations.

## Phase 2: Create a Simple Game

### 1. Design the Simple Game
- Conceptualize a simple game idea (e.g., a 2D platformer).

### 2. Develop the Simple Game
- Set up a new Unity project.
- Implement core mechanics and features.
- Test and debug the game.

### 3. Polish and Package
- Refine UI, add sound effects, and optimize performance.
- Build and package the game for different platforms.

## Phase 3: Develop a Commercial Idle Game

### 1. Plan the Idle Game
- Research successful idle games.
- Create a game design document (GDD) outlining core gameplay, progression, and monetization.

### 2. Prototype and Develop
- Set up a new Unity project for the idle game.
- Develop a prototype and iterate based on feedback.
- Implement features, art, and polish.

### 3. Prepare for Launch
- Finalize and optimize the game.
- Publish on the App Store and Google Play Market.
